# Pygame 2048

This is a simple implementation of the 2048 game using Pygame.

## Description

2048 is a popular sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to move the tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one.
- With every move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) will appear in a random empty spot.
- The game ends when there are no more moves available, or when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
